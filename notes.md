## Working assumptions
* Across series, credits will likely be structurally similar enough per episode to correlate their sequences.
* Repeated sequeces of images across episodes are generally exclusive to credit sequences.
* Opening credits are longer that n seconds (at least 5, shorter than this arguably dosen't need skipping)
* There might be clips before or after credits.
* Opening and closing credits are within the first and last n minitues (~=5) of a episode.

## possible problems:
* constant darkness, not much contrast
* re-used sequences other than introâ€”no anime.
* maybe buffer time at the end of intro so you dont miss anything
* specific episode titles
* how to split up soaps.
    - maybe compare to average image
* do we get series as a totality or episode by episode.* darkness might be a prob
* some dont have intros
